# Mortgage Repayment Admin 
This is a simple mortgage repayment admin app built with Streamlit. It is a frontend app that allow a receipt to be uploaded and apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract information from the image. The information is used to populate a form that use [mortgage repayment API](https://github.com/statsit/mortgage-app.git) to calculate the monthly repayment and total repayment. The form is then submitted to the backend API for storage in the database. The app also allow the user to view all the mortgage repayment records in the database.
